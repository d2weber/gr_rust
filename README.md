# GR-ust

This is an attempt to create rust bindings to [GNURadio](https://www.gnuradio.org/). It's quite experimental.

### Requirements

* GNURadio installed on the system (tested with 3.10.1.1)
* Rust compiler

### Usage

To run a (very) simple flowgraph from rust that creates an `output.bin`:

```
  cargo run
```
